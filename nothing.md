# The Game of Nothing - Privacy Policy

The app itself does not ask directly to the user for any information to be collected.
In the end, the user is asked for his name in order to be displayed on a certificate of achievement, but this name is stored locally.
The existent database is local and it only contains information related to the game itself.  

The app uses Google AdMob in order to display ads in return for hints.
