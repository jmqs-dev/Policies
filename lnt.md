# Late Night Temptations - Privacy Policy

This policy outlines how information is handled when using the application. Privacy is an important factor and transparency must always be provided when dealing with sensitive topics.

• No personal information is collected from the users. The database used to manage the application is stored locally on the device (deleting cache will delete all of the information the user has submitted), and, as such, it is only available for whoever is authorized to access said device.

• Some checks will be performed on the device to determine if it's a safe environment for the application to run on. Security is also a priority and content will be blocked in case these checks fail or if it has been determined the application was obtained from non official means/stores.

• No information is uploaded to a server, as the application is not connected to any. It is also not shared or sold to any third parties, as it is not collected. As previously stated, everything is stored locally and any information retrieved from the device is solely used for the experience and not disclosed.

This policy will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the application or legal requirements.
By using this application, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
